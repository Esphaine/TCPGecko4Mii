# TCPGecko4Mii
A custom build of TCPGecko that can be used in conjunction with Mii Maker.

If you want to make cheat codes for Mii Maker, there are a few things that you should know:

Using codes that involve doing things already available within the Mii Editor (such as changing your Mii's hairstyle or name) will require you to save your Mii before the changes render. So for example, if a code was sent that changes your Mii's hairstyle, the Mii will still render with its old hairstyle until you save.

Modifying anything that involves text will shift over the bytes that make up your Mii. For example, if your Mii has 2 characters in its name, the addresses you will be using for codes will be different than what they are if your Mii has 8 characters in its name. If you end up using a code that was working at some point but breaks seemingly out of nowhere, this is probably why.

Have fun making some abominations <3
